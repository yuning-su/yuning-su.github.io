I am a PhD candidate under the guidance of Prof. Xing-Dong Yang at the Interactive Experiences Lab (ixLab) of Simon Fraser University. My scholarly pursuits predominantly lie at the crossroads of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with a specific focus on computational materials and haptics technologies. I publish papers at top-tier venues like the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST) and the International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp).
